# UNITY ENGINE AND SAFE VOICE

## Overview and Origin
### Company Name
Unity Software Incorporated

### When was the company incorporated?
The company was founded in 2004.

### Who are the founders of the company?
The founders of the company are David Helgason (CEO), Nicholas Francis (CCO), and Joachim Ante (CTO).

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The company was originally called Over the Edge Entertainment and was founded to develop video games. Their first game, GooBall was not successful. However, the founders saw significant demand for the tools they created during the development process. The company rebranded themselves as Unity, named after their game engine, and shifted focus towards development of game creation tools across multiple platforms. In 2018 Unity partnered with Google Cloud and DeepMind to develop AI to train algorithms that can learn through trial and error to create more realistic gaming environments. 

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Unity is a publicly traded corporation on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol “U”. The current market cap for Unity is over 12 billion and stock prices have fluctuated significantly over the last decade.

## Business Activities
### What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Since the development of online multiplayer games, toxicity has proliferated across the gaming community. Threats, insults, racism, and verbal assaults have become increasingly problematic and can negatively affect the overall success of a game. Online moderation teams can mitigate toxicity to a certain degree but are easily overwhelmed when game players can number in the millions. Relying on player reports can help but this doesn’t consider players who simply move on to other games rather than report bad behavior. 

### Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers.
Safe Voice from Unity is an AI-driven toxicity detection solution designed for online gaming community moderation teams with large player bases. In 2022 the online gaming market size was valued at 61.7 billion dollars and is estimated to rise to 163.0 billion by 2023. The online gaming market saw a significant boost in revenue in 2020 due to the VOID-19 pandemic. As this industry increases in size, so does the player base that supports it. Online games succeed or fail based solely on the size of their player communities. 

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Safe Voice from Unity is an AI-driven toxicity solution detection service designed to monitor interactions between players. Safe Voice identifies toxic interactions through context. Safe Voice AI is being trained to detect toxic behaviors by monitoring audio disruptions, obscenities, threats, problematic speech, and other verbal attacks. 

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? 
Unity Safe Voice’s ability to differentiate between verbal attacks and harmless banter between players improves through utilization of AI-centric technologies such as advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Safe Voice can address toxic behavior quickly by analyzing verbal communications.

## Landscape
### What field is the company in?
Unity is, first and foremost, a gaming development company that specializes in engines and tools used to create content for a variety of companies including Disney, Electronic Arts, and Ubisoft. Unity Engine has been used to create several high-profile and successful games including Angry Birds 2, Cuphead, Hollow Knight, Subnautica, and Hearthstone.

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5-10 years?
Gaming has become an increasingly social platform where players can engage each other using written and verbal communication. While several communities have developed over time within online games, there continues to be a small but problematic subset of gamers who enjoy making the environment more difficult for other players. Gaming companies have developed several solutions to this problem including moderation, text monitoring, and player reporting systems. Unfortunately, there are limitations to these methods. There tend to be fewer moderators in relation to the number of players and they can quickly become overwhelmed as they attempt to address issues. While monitoring text can help, most systems cannot tell the difference between toxic behavior and normal conversation. Relying on players to report issues is also problematic. Reports can be inconsistent, and systems can even be used for false reporting. As game development costs continue to rise, and game scope increases, larger companies stick with “tried and true” intellectual properties. As a result, there have been relatively fewer new IPs generated. No one wants to risk several million dollars on an unproven IP that may not succeed. Consequently, there has been a surge of smaller, more focused games created by independent developers. These smaller companies have lower overhead which allows them to be more experimental in game design. It also means these smaller companies have fewer resources for things like tool development, and player moderation. 

### What are the other major companies in this field?
There are several companies that specialize in content moderation and customer service including Digital Minds BPO, Genpact, and TaskUS. 
Digital Minds BPO offers multiple moderation services. Services include text moderation, image moderation, video moderation, and gaming. 
Genpact also leverages artificial intelligence to moderate content. Genpact specializes in ad integrity and brand safety. 
TaskUs provides actual human moderators to ensure customer interactions are safe and productive. 
Game Engine development is a healthy offshoot of the gaming industry, with major players from several companies offering development tools to supplement the cost of developing the tools needed for game creation. Developing a new engine to build your game on, and then licensing out the engine after your game is complete, is a sound business strategy. Unreal Engine and Unity are two of the most popular solutions in the industry. Unreal is one of the top platforms for real-time 3D game development. Other popular engines include Godot, Amazon Game Engines, and CryEngine. 

## Results
### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Safe Voice is currently in closed Beta, so its impact on the gaming industry has yet to be quantified. Test cases have been positive thus far, with developers praising the increased visibility into their communities that Safe Voice provides. 
Unity has been responsible for some of the most popular games in the last 5 to 10 years. Unity Engine offers a free version that makes it the preferred engine for independent developers. Unity also supports multiple platforms including Android, IOS, Mac, Microsoft, and all the major console platforms. 

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success?
Success in the gaming industry can be measured in sales and customer engagement. Successful gaming software development tools are present in a large number of popular games and are widely utilized across the industry. Success in content moderation results in an overall healthier and friendlier community. 
 
### How is your company performing based on these metrics?
Again, Unity’s Safe Voice software is still in closed beta, but initial feedback has been positive with users praising the software’s ability to give more visibility in their communities and more tools to mitigate toxic behavior in real time. 

### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
Unity is one of the top engines to use for developing games. It is intuitive, cost effective, and powerful. Unity Engine has been used to create several recent gaming hits and is considered to be an effective alternative to in-house engine development. 

## Recommendations
### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
Unity’s direct competitor is Unreal Engine. Unreal is also currently investigating the uses of AI in their technology, but they are focusing on world physics, decision trees, and non-player-character behavior. The importance of player moderation cannot be overstated, but investing resources into AI research for game enhancement will ensure that Unity stays competitive in the future. 

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Artificial Intelligence can be used in a variety of ways that would benefit Unity. From code development to image generation and world behavior. AI could potentially streamline the development process and allow smaller development companies to leverage their limited resources to greater effect.
